# 311-Project: Urban Data Clustering and Correlation Analysis

## Overview

The 311-Project is a comprehensive data analysis suite developed to interpret urban dynamics through government 311 service request data. It assists city planners, municipal decision-makers, and public work managers by providing spatial clustering and spatiotemporal correlation analysis, essential for urban planning and efficient resource allocation.

## Project Description

The 311-Project consists of several components, each leveraging specialized software to perform its functions:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Utilizing Alteryx, the project cleans and pre-processes raw 311 data, preparing it for detailed analysis.

2. **Spatial Clustering Program**: This segment uses a DBSCAN clustering algorithm, facilitated by libraries such as SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and scikit-learn, to spatially analyze service request data and identify significant clusters.

3. **Spatiotemporal Correlation Analysis Program**: Following spatial clustering, this section employs Geopandas and Shapely to examine the temporal correlation between different service request types over various weeks.

4. **Data Storage and Management**: The MySQL database system is utilized to store the initial data set and the processed correlation results for subsequent analysis.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Tableau dashboard visualizations present the analysis, enabling interactive exploration of the data and insights derived from the project.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Management with MySQL
- Stores the initial and processed data sets.
- Facilitates data retrieval for analysis.

### Spatial Clustering with Python
- Connects to MySQL to fetch data.
- Uses Python libraries for clustering analysis.
- Outputs results to a CSV file for further analysis.

### Spatiotemporal Correlation with Geopandas
- Reads clustering results for spatial analysis.
- Calculates distances and correlations between service request types.
- Produces a detailed CSV output with correlation results.

### Visualization with Tableau
- Creates an interactive dashboard for data exploration.
- Allows users to filter and view data according to various parameters.
- Enhances user understanding of urban service request patterns.

## Applications

The 311-Project suite is tailored to facilitate urban planning by revealing patterns in service requests. By providing a clear picture of where and when services are needed, city officials can better predict future requirements and allocate resources more effectively.

## Conclusion

The 311-Project stands out as a multidisciplinary tool that combines data processing, spatial analysis, and visualization. It not only elucidates the present state of urban service requests but also predicts future trends, enabling smarter city planning and management.
