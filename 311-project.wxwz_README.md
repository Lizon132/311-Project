# Alteryx Workflow for 311 Service Requests Analysis

## Overview

This Alteryx workflow is designed to import, process, and analyze 311 service requests data. The workflow includes several nodes that handle data importing, filtering, and exporting tasks. It is tailored to work with large datasets, ensuring efficient data management and analysis.

## Workflow Description

The workflow is structured as follows:

1. **Data Importing**: 
   - The workflow starts with importing data from a specified CSV file. This step involves reading the data, ensuring correct formats, and preparing it for subsequent processing.

2. **Data Processing and Filtering**:
   - The workflow includes multiple filtering nodes, which clean and refine the data. These nodes remove null values, and filter records based on specific criteria like location coordinates and department divisions.
   - Regex functions are applied to process and format certain data fields.

3. **Data Exporting**:
   - The final step of the workflow is exporting the processed data. The data is saved in a specific format, ready for further analysis or reporting.

## Key Components

- **Tool Containers**: The workflow is organized into different tool containers, each labeled according to the function it performs (e.g., 'Data Importing', 'Data Processing').
- **Filter Tools**: These tools apply various conditions to the data, ensuring that only relevant and correctly formatted data passes through the workflow.
- **Database File Input and Output Tools**: These tools handle the reading of input data from CSV files and writing the output to a specified database or file format.
- **Browse Tools**: They are used for data inspection and profiling at different stages of the workflow.
- **Union Tool**: This tool combines data from different streams, ensuring a cohesive data set is available for final output.
- **Custom Actions**: The workflow includes custom actions for dynamic data handling based on specific conditions or user inputs.

## Usage

To use this workflow, users should have access to Alteryx Designer and the required input data in a CSV format. After loading the workflow, users can execute it to process the 311 service requests data according to the defined steps.

## Requirements

- Alteryx Designer
- Access to the 311 service requests data in CSV format

## Conclusion

This Alteryx workflow provides an automated and efficient solution for processing large datasets of 311 service requests. Its structured approach to data import, filtering, and export makes it a valuable tool for
