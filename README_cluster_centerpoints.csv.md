## About `cluster_centerpoints.csv`

The `cluster_centerpoints.csv` file is a key output of the 311-Analysis Spatial Clustering Program. This CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file contains the calculated center points of spatial clusters identified from the analysis of 311 service request data. Each row in this file represents a unique cluster, providing insights into the geographic concentration of various types of service requests in the city.

### File Structure

The file comprises several columns, each containing specific information about the clusters:

- **ClusterID**: A unique identifier assigned to each cluster.
- **Year**: The year in which the service requests were made.
- **Week**: The week of the year when the service requests were recorded.
- **SR TYPE**: The type of service request (e.g., Air Pollution, Potholes).
- **Latitude**: The latitude coordinate of the cluster's center.
- **Longitude**: The longitude coordinate of the cluster's center.

### Usage

This file is instrumental for city planners and analysts in:
- Identifying hotspots for specific types of service requests.
- Understanding spatial patterns in urban service needs.
- Informing targeted responses and resource allocation.

The data in `cluster_centerpoints.csv` also serves as the basis for further spatiotemporal correlation analysis in the subsequent phase of the 311-Analysis project.
